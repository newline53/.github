# Contributing to This Project

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Newline by Fifth Third! Because we are part of a regulated banking environment, we operate with stricter security controls than most open-source projects. Please read the guidelines below before interacting with our repositories.

## 🚫 Pull Requests Are Not Accepted

Due to internal security policies, **we do not accept external pull requests**. If you would like to help improve our projects, please open an issue instead (details below).

All code changes are handled by our project maintainers.

## 🐛 Reporting Bugs

If you encounter unexpected behavior or issues while using our projects:

1. **Open an Issue** on GitHub.

Security issues can be safely reported to Newline's [Vulnerability Management Team](VulnerabilityManagement.Bancorp@53.com")

This ensures that vulnerabilities are handled responsibly and do not put users at risk.
